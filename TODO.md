# Polygraph

* Support transformations of the series, e.g. add a moving average,
or calculate a monthly average from an hourly timeseries, etc.

* How to do filtering and aggregation?  E.g. calculate a monthly 
average for some hours in a time bucket.

* Support different types of plots.  For example if there is no 
variable on the Y axis, show a histogram of the variable on the 
X axis.
